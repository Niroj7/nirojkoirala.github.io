            <strong>Early Life and Education:</strong><br>
            I was born and raised in the picturesque hills of Nepal, a country celebrated for its stunning landscapes and rich cultural heritage. Growing up in such an environment, technology was not initially a focal point in my life. However, as I matured, I developed a keen interest in the transformative power of technology and its potential to shape the future. This realization led me to pursue a deeper understanding of the field.<br><br>

            <strong>Academic Journey:</strong><br>
            My academic journey began at Everest College in Nepal, where I was fortunate to receive a full scholarship. This opportunity provided me with a solid educational foundation and ignited my passion for learning. The experiences and knowledge gained at Everest College were instrumental in preparing me for my subsequent studies.<br><br>

            Eager to expand my horizons, I moved on to LaGuardia Community College in New York to study Computer Science. At LaGuardia, I dedicated myself to my coursework and projects, graduating with honors and a GPA of 3.89. The rigorous academic environment and hands-on experience at LaGuardia significantly enhanced my understanding of technology.<br><br>

            Following my graduation from LaGuardia, I transferred to York College to further my studies. My time at York College has been both challenging and rewarding. I have had the opportunity to delve into advanced topics in Computer Science and engage in meaningful research. I am honored to have been awarded an NSF scholarship, which has provided crucial support for my studies and research endeavors.<br><br>

            <strong>Future Aspirations:</strong><br>
            Looking ahead, I am enthusiastic about the possibilities in the tech industry. One of my primary goals is to develop a soccer game that combines my passion for the sport with my growing expertise in technology. I am eager to create innovative and immersive digital experiences that can connect people and enhance their enjoyment of the game.<br><br>

            <strong>Personal Interests:</strong><br>
            Outside of academics, I have a diverse set of interests that keep me engaged and motivated. I am passionate about soccer and enjoy following and playing the sport whenever possible. Chess is another favorite pastime, as it challenges my strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, I stay informed by keeping up with current events and news, which helps me remain connected with the world and informed about global developments.<br>
